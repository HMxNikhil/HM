# 🚀 AI Collaboration Hub for Hackathons

## 🌟 Overview
The **AI Collaboration Hub** is your AI-powered hackathon co-pilot. It combines **Generative AI** and **agentic multi-agent intelligence** to help teams:

- Brainstorm **creative project ideas**  
- Design **scalable architectures**  
- Generate **starter code & features**  
- Produce **documentation and pitch decks**  

All in **real-time**, so your team can focus on building impactful projects, not repetitive setup tasks.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **💡 Idea Generation**  
   - Enter a theme or problem domain (e.g., “HealthTech”).  
   - **Idea Agent** proposes 3–5 innovative project concepts.  
   - Pick your favorite idea to move forward.  

2. **🛠 Architecture & Tech Stack**  
   - **Architect Agent** suggests frontend & backend frameworks, databases, and generates a system architecture diagram.  

3. **💻 Code Generation**  
   - **Code Agent** scaffolds boilerplate code.  
   - Add features interactively, e.g., *“Add user login with JWT”*.  

4. **📄 Documentation & Pitch**  
   - **Doc Agent** creates README, API docs, and a pitch slide automatically.  

5. **👥 Team Collaboration**  
   - Real-time workspace with chat, task tracking, and agent assistance.
