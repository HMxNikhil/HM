# AI Collaboration Hub for Hackathons
Description

The AI Collaboration Hub is a web-based platform designed to supercharge hackathon teams by leveraging Generative AI and multi-agent system intelligence. It helps participants brainstorm ideas, design project architectures, generate starter code, and create documentation—all in real time.

Unlike traditional tools, this platform uses agentic AI to enable emergent collaboration between specialized agents:

Idea Agent – generates creative, high-impact project concepts.

Architect Agent – suggests scalable tech stacks and system architecture diagrams.

Code Agent – produces boilerplate code and feature scaffolds.

Documentation Agent – automatically generates README files, API documentation, and pitch decks.

The system is real-time, collaborative, and scalable, allowing teams to focus on building and innovating rather than repetitive setup tasks. This project demonstrates how emergent system intelligence can enhance team productivity and creativity in hackathon settings.
